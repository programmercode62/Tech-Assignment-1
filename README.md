# Tech-Assignment-1
The description of the assignment is to get us familar with web serving and coding in Python. 
In challenge 1, we were to solve various problems with Python. For the problem with obtaining the average, I first checked if the type of the input is not a list. It should return None. Then I checked if it is an empty list. It should return 0. Lastly, I checked each element if any of them is string. I should then return None. For the problem with prime numbers,  first I checked the number is less than 2. It should return False. Then, I divide the number with all numbers from 2 and immediate before the number. If in any case, remainder is 0, return False. For the problem with finding the first 100 prime numbers, 
I made a variable count the number of primes, another with the starting number and increment by 1 each time. For the problem with counting letters, I made all inputs lowercase, convert it to a list of elements, check each element is letter or not and if letter, assign it to the dictionary. For the problem with filtetering strings,  I check each string in the list if
    1. if the string has at least 5 letters
    2. if it contains at least one vowel
For the problem with detetermiing palindromes, I convert the number to a string. Then I flip the string and compare original and flipped version. 

For Challenge 2, I solved it with using webserving through FAST API and made a html file to upload my responses to the problem.

The tutorials allowed me to discover how to use Git, set up Anaconda and a Python coding platform, discover hwo to code in Python, and use FAST API.
